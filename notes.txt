Notes 
    clip-path 
        used to clip the image in desired shape
        ex:polygon, triangle etc shape for the image
    span
        can be used to style two things differently
        but interpret both as single 
        ex:Heading with caption
    center a div
        if we don't know it's size or it has some big shape
        position: absolute;
        top: 50%;
        left: 50%;
        now div little to the right from center because of it's size
        transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
        translate will move 50% of ***it's own width and height to left and top respectively
        so this make center of div is centered inside parent
    transition is used for simple animations
    animations 
        create 
            @keyframes animation-name
        use 
            animation : animation-name 1s
