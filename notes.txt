Notes 
    CSS behind the scenes
        CSS parsing in browser
            cascade
                combine different style sheets
                resolve conflicting CSS declarations
                priority order 
                    important > specificity > source order 
                    specificity
                        inline > id > classes > elements
                        1 id > 1000 classes
                        1 class > 1000 elements
                        * selector has no specificity value
            process final css values
            CSS Object Model (CSSOM) is created
            DOM and CSSOM forms Render tree 
            website is rendered
    units 
        em  
            relative to it's parent font size
            for lengths, it is relative to it's current font size
        rem 
            relative to a base font-size
            base/root font size is usually 16px
            we can override root font size like 
                html {
                    font-size: 12px;
                }
        vh,vw are viewport(screen) height and viewport(screen) width
    why to change px units to rem?
        we can easily change all measurement with 1 change i.e. root font size
        for mobile, all measurements will be automatically adjusted
        it changes measurements according to user preference(front size)
        help ensure consistency across different devices and screen sizes. 
        Since REMs are based on the root font size
    pseudo classes 
        special state of an element.
        ex: for anchor (a) tag
        a:link
            unvisited state 
        a:visited
        a:hover
        a:active 
            selected state
        and also first-child, last-child etc 
    pseudo elements
        used to style specified parts of an element
        ex: ::first-letter,::before,::after,::selection etc

    display 
        inline 
            no height and width properties
            can have left & right margins and padding, but not top & bottom
            occupies only content size.
            displays the element inline or on the same line
            ex: span,a, img
        inline-block
            same as inline 
            can set height and width
            respect top & bottom margins and padding
        block 
            starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (parent width).
            can set width and height
    position
        default
            normal flow
            position:relative;
        Floats 
            element removed from normal flow 
            text and inline elements will wrap around floated element
            container will not adjust it's height to the element
            float:left;
            float:right;
        absolute 
            element removed from normal flow 
            no impact on surrounding content or elements
            top,bottom,right,left are used to offset the element from it's relative positioned container
            position:absolute
            position:fixed
    

    Meaning full class names 
        Block Element Modifier (BEM)
            Block 
                standalone component that is meaningfull on it's only 
            Element
                part of block, that has no standalone meaning 
            Modifier
                a different version of block or element
            ex: .header {}
            .header__main {}
            .header__main-white {}

    SAAS
        CSS preprocessor
        SAAS code -> compiled CSS code
        features
            variables
            nesting
            operators
                for math operations in CSS 
            Partials and imports 
                to write CSS in different files and importing them into 1 single file
                file name starts with underscore
            Mixins
                to write reusable pieces of CSS code 
                create
                    @mixin name {}
                use 
                    @include name
            Functions 
                similar to mixins, with difference that they can return a value that can be used 
                create
                    @function name {}
                use 
                    name()
            extends
                to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them
                create placeholder 
                    %name {}
                use
                    @extend %name
            control directives
                for writing complex code using conditions and loops
            SASS vs SCSS syntax 
                SASS don't have {}, SCSS have {}                
                SASS
                    .nav 
                        list-item:none;

                        & li 
                            margin-left:30px;
                SCSS
                    .nav {
                        list-item:none;

                        & li {
                            margin-left:30px;
                        }
                    }
            $var-name is used to create variables
            & copies selector until that point inside nested
        folder structure for sass (7-1)
            styles
                main.scss
                base
                    presets
                    animations
                    typography
                    utilities etc
                layout
                abstracts
                    functions 
                    mixins
                    variables
                components
                pages
                themes
                vendors


    clip-path 
        used to clip the image in desired shape
        ex:polygon, triangle etc shape for the image
    span
        can be used to style two things differently
        but interpret both as single 
        ex:Heading with caption
    center a div
        if we don't know it's size or it has some big shape
        position: absolute;
        top: 50%;
        left: 50%;
        now div little to the right from center because of it's size
        transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
        translate will move 50% of ***it's own width and height to left and top respectively
        so this make center of div is centered inside parent
    transition is used for simple animations
    animations 
        create 
            @keyframes animation-name
        use 
            animation : animation-name 1s
